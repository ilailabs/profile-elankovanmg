## ABOUT ME
<!--
I still remember the days I played with LEDs diodes DC motors and dismantling the toys bursting out of curiousity, electronics was my favourite hobby I prefer it than playing with my friends outdoors.
Those were the most beautiful days of my childhood.
One fine day during my middle school I went in argument with my Chemistry teacher saying 'Mam your theory isn't working' after giving a try to electroplate one rupee coin with copper.
She suggested me to use any Cu salt instead of table salt, I never know that.
The following week I stole copper sulphate from my Lab.
OMG! it worked my euraka moments and I had plenty of those moments which I could't share with anyone. Initially I was intrested in physics because of this reason, next favourite subject was Math the reason being you need not put any efforts to score high. I was a lazy kid.
Observe and enjoy the class, the first time I solve that problem would be on my exam hall.
I am bit famous in my class because of these two reasons everyone knows if question paper is tough *Elango* would top the class at the same time I am the one with lowest score in Language subjects.
Why do you expect a child to be good at everything? I didn't feel like impressing neither my teachers nor my parents.
It's an attitude that I carried from my young age, latter when I grewup I become an introverted person.
But at times I wanted my parents to appreciate me when I score good and scolde me when I underperform.
My dad is self-employed owns a small business and very thoughtfull, I just remember the two pieces of advice that he gave me *'have big desires,  only then you'll find a way'*, *'wake before the sun, success is assured'*. My mother is a homemaker and she is intrested much in tailoring and embrodiary works. My elder sister is discipled hardworking and nerd, I am exactly opposite that of her and do all mischevious things.
I hate when my parents say 'learn from her, the way she is'.Now she's a mother to a little kid and works for IT. Life gave me some new demonstrations when I turned 21, I was depressed to the core for some reasons, my dad is unable to recover from the financial crash that he had few years back. I belived I deserve a better life and the following year I managed to get into the nations best institues for masters degree of my choice. -->

<!-- > Learn form the best, Aim for the best. -->

<!-- I'm native to Chennai and 25 years old.
My dad is self employed and own's a small bussiness my family lives here for more than three decades.
I am the youngest of two childrens and My sister works for TCS she's married and has small kid.
Despite my home beeing just 22 kms from IITM campus I choose to stay in hostel.
My mom is a Tailor and homemaker so loving and caring. -->

<!-- {
I know this decision would change my life but had no idea upto what extend will it.
It is here I started learning music, two foriegn languages and started discovering myself. I'm excited about the opporunites that I may get tommorw so preparing hard and learning hard to live.

## LIFE AT IITM

<!-- > It's possible to be busy without being effective. -->

<!-- IIT life is all about time management. Its not IIT which changed my life, it's the people and friends whom I met in IITM.
It is a very busy life, it's fun and frustrating sometimes. I felt like calling myself a scholar after a year of joining, it was hard for me to cope up with the standrads in the first year and now I cultivated the habit of reading scientific documents and prolonged concentration.
I had time for my family and friends every weekend and I also had time for learing new languages and music -->

.<!-- Some people have said *Elango* your a good listener, May be it's true. I have friends who called me and said 'I feel like commiting sucide' -->

<!-- Research is all about learning to have patience and high degree of self-dicipline. -->
<!-- It was a self-realisation no one ever said this to me. -->
<!-- It's my moment of truth, no one ever said this to me.
You keep reading the whole day and still say *'I don't still understand what they mean to convey'* and you still have patience to keep reading further.
Results may disappoint you most of the times and you still carry out simulations with hope.
Honestly I never had such self-dicipline before.
Change is hard but it's beautiful -->
.<!-- My guide is never gonna ask me why you did't come to lab, but it's me who is commited to work for atleast eight hours a day. -->
<!-- I gained a new momentum.
After lot of experimentation on myself I am consistent with my stable and balanced routine which are in alignement with my short and long term goals. -->
<!-- The day usually starts at 4.30 AM with ginger tea, I cared my fitness and personal being, Everyday I had unschduled time of 90min for myself after my dinner. -->


<!-- The day starts without an alarm around 4.30 AM with subraba's(canteen) ginger tea.
I plan my day while haveing cought of the fresh chill air strolling to canteen.
Bath before sunrise, prayer and practice my music for about an hour.
Once I'm done reading one journal I'll start my room.
Spending minmum of 9 Hours in lab was the goal.
Without a power nap after my lunch my engine wouldn't start.
Before leaving the hostel I would spend minimum of 15 minutes learing and revising my spanish and german vocabulary.
Then a juice.
Back to lab.
Then to ground for a mild jog and workout.
I have unschduled hours without plans after my dinner till the bed time, it's here I spend time for myself.
This how I spend atleast 4 out of 7 days in my week. -->

<!-- "Wake before the sun. Have big desires only then you'll find a way" are the only two advices I remember my dad gave to me when I was in middle SCHOOLING
I learnt to wear a confident simile. -->

##RESEARCH
<!-- I joined *Computational Mechanics and Materials* research group in July 2017 lead by prof. Narasimhan Swaminathan as a Masters research scholar under his supervision and co-guided by Dr. CVK[PD]
Since then my life took a new trejectory.
I gained new momentum and took quantum leaps.
It was a blessing to work with world class researchers like them.
The exposure and opporunites one gets here is truly unparallel to any other collages I know that and I decided to bring the best out of me.
My inclination towards science education and the love I had for my family was the true motivating factor to graduate from elite premier institues like IIT.
Desires to persue masters was my choice when my parents wished me to takeup a job aftermy undergrad.
I was training myself hard and truly started enjoing my academics and personal life like never before. -->
