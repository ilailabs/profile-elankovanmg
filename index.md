## 1. About Me

I joined Computational Materials Modelling(CMM) Group in 2017 lead by [Prof. Narasimhan Swaminathan](https://home.iitm.ac.in/n.swaminathan/) as an [<u>Interdisciplinary</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lel8A2oP7el56gdNdnFva8FgbY1ygW0s/view?usp=sharing) research scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering(Design) and in the Department of Physics under the research supervision of [Prof. C. V. Krishnamurthy.](http://iitm.irins.org/profile/61936)
Inclination towards Science and Mathematics and the love that I had for my family has motivated me to join IITM to pursue research education.
My first emotional touch and 'aah haa! moment' with science was during my middle school days when I turned a stainless steel coin into a copper coated one (stole some copper sulphate salt from my chemistry lab, I was naughty and mischievous boy those days)
I also didnâ€™t believe in a few of the things that my physics teacher taught me, so I had to do some stone throwing experiments from my terrace.
I was a little curious kid in me so badly wanting to experiment things.
Those days were one among the happiest phases of my life and I had aspirations of becoming an Engineer someday since then.
I have always admired technology and the way they empower  humankind.
Internet and Flying machines were my favourite.

Philosophy and Psychology is something that I appreciate and understand apart from my discipline.
I was most influenced by the teachings of Dr. Jordan Petersons and his views on life and also inspired by the writings of American Philosopher Dr. Wyane Dyer.
I recently developed some interest in Entrepreneurship and Behavioural science, influenced by the talks of [Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) & some of the professors I met, [Prof LSG](https://doms.iitm.ac.in/index.php/ganesh-l-s) (DoMs-IITM) and [Prof Murali](https://www.ubc.ca/about/one-on-one/leadership/murali-chandrashekaran.html) from UBC who mentored me for a social project.
