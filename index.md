## 1. About Me

I joined Computational Materials Modelling(CMM) Group in 2017 lead by [Prof. Narasimhan Swaminathan](https://home.iitm.ac.in/n.swaminathan/) as an interdisciplinary research scholar in the **Department of Mechanical Engineering(Design)** and in the **Department of Physics** under the research supervision of [Prof. C. V. Krishnamurthy.](http://iitm.irins.org/profile/61936)
My Inclination towards Science and Mathematics and the love that I had for my family was my motivation to join IITM to pursue research education.
My first real encounter with science was during my middle school days when I successfully electroplated a stainless-steel coin into a copper coated one with a mobile phone charger and unused copper wires (stole some copper sulphate salt from my chemistry lab)
I also couldn't believe in a few interesting things my physics teacher taught me, until I convinced myself doing small science experiments.
I was very curious and had too much fun experimenting with some science stuff and enjoyed playing with diodes, DC motors and LEDs with my cousin.
In Fact I think spending too much time with myself in my early childhood days has reflected in my introverted(mostly) personality when I grew up.
Those days were the happiest days of my life and I had aspirations of becoming a world class engineer someday since then.
I always had fascination over technology and the way they empower  humankind.
The Internet and flying machines were my favourite among them.

Philosophy and Psychology is something that I appreciate and understand apart from my discipline.
I was most influenced by the teachings of Dr. Jordan Peterson and his views on life and also inspired by the writings of american philosopher Dr. Wyane Dyer.
I recently developed some interest in Entrepreneurship and Behavioural science, influenced by the talks of [Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) & some of the professors I met in the past few years, [Prof LSG](https://doms.iitm.ac.in/index.php/ganesh-l-s) (DoMs-IITM) and [Prof Murali](https://www.ubc.ca/about/one-on-one/leadership/murali-chandrashekaran.html) from UBC who mentored me for a [social project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JGrOQwY2iX0jIlT7IARku8VyugIvNgbP/view?usp=sharing).

## 2. Research at IITM

### <u>Kapitza Resistance And Elastic Phonon ScatteringProperties of Grain Boundaries in Diamond-Silicon</u>

<p align="center"><img src="images/19-c.png"></p>
I studied the thermal heat transport characteristics of various Grain Boundary(GB) interfaces in silicon bicrystal models using computer simulations.
GBs are very thin amorphous layers between two crystals with relative misorientation to each other as shown above.
When the thermal energy(heat) flows from crystal A(on the left) to crystal B(on the right) there is some energy loss due to thermal energy carrier scattering at the interface.
This results in a temperature drop or discontinuity to the flow of thermal heat current.
Different interfaces show different temperature drops to the same magnitude of thermal heat current, and therefore thermal boundary resistance is an intrinsic property of the interface.
I studied various symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Silicon trying to figure out on what factors these thermal boundary resistance depends.

<br><br>
To get deeper insights into the thermal boundary resistance, the later part of the research focuses on phonon-wave-packet(could be considered as a particle of heat) scattering at the interface.
Since the mechanism of Sound and Heat propagation in a crystalline solid is similar, we investigated the wave-packet that propagates across the interface. The animation below shows a wave-packet passing through an one-dimensional model of an interface where some part of a wave is reflected and most of them are transmitted at the interface.

**Potential Applications**:
* In the design of functional materials like microelectronic semiconductor devices
* Design of new structural materials for high thermal applications such as jet engine isolations, etc.

**Simulations Techniques**:
* Python and Matlab for modeling the GB-bicrystal samples.
* Molecular Dynamics(MD) techniques to perform heat flow simulations using [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Intro_overview.html) software package
* [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/) software package to visualise the GB models
* OVITO-python interpreter, and python for post-processing the simulations results
