## 1. About Me

I joined Computational Materials Modelling(CMM) Group in 2017 lead by [Prof. Narasimhan Swaminathan](https://home.iitm.ac.in/n.swaminathan/) as an [<u>Interdisciplinary</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkXWoNmhD11DaDYZPCuqvqhp2ZtykJT2/view?usp=sharing) research scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering(Design) and in the Department of Physics under the research supervision of [Prof. C. V. Krishnamurthy.](http://iitm.irins.org/profile/61936)
My Inclination towards Science and Mathematics and the love that I had for my family was my motivation to join IITM to pursue research education.
My first 'aah haa! moment' with science was during my middle school days when I sucessfully electroplated a stainless-steel coin into a copper coated one with a mobile phone charger and unused copper wires (stole some copper sulphate salt from my chemistry lab, I was naughty and mischievous kid those days)
I also couldn't believe in a few interesting things my Physics teacher taught me, until I convice myself doing small science experiments.
I was very curious and had too much fun with experimenting some science stuffs and enjoyed playing with diodes DC motors and LEDs with my cousin.
Infact I think spending too much time with myself in my early childhood days has reflected in my introverted(mostly) personality when I grew up.
Those days were one among the happiest phases of my life and I had aspirations of becoming an World Class Engineer someday since then.
I have always fascinated and admired technology the way they empower  humankind.
Internet and Flying machines were my favourite.

Philosophy and Psychology is something that I appreciate and understand apart from my discipline.
I was most influenced by the teachings of Dr. Jordan Peterson and his views on life and also inspired by the writings of American Philosopher Dr. Wyane Dyer.
I recently developed some interest in Entrepreneurship and Behavioural science, influenced by the talks of [Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) & some of the professors I met, [Prof LSG](https://doms.iitm.ac.in/index.php/ganesh-l-s) (DoMs-IITM) and [Prof Murali](https://www.ubc.ca/about/one-on-one/leadership/murali-chandrashekaran.html) from UBC who mentored me for a social project.
